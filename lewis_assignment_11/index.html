    <h1>Music</h1>
    <p id="p1">
      What is the one thing that everybody in the world has in common? It is the
      love of music. We are introduced as a baby to music when our mothers and
      fathers would sing us nursery rhymes. Music is also all over the world in
      every country and in every language. It would be hard to find anyone that
      does not music of some kind. It is one of the easiest ways to get us to
      come together, by singing a song together, whether in a classroom, in a
      church, at your job, or in a car. Music can help with many illnesses
      including depression by either taking your mind off your illness or the
      words of the song touching your heart. In this web site we are going to
      educate you a little about music.
